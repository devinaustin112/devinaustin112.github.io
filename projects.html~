						<b class= "par_header"> Pirex </b>
					Pirex was completed as a semester long project in Software Engineering, CS 345, during the fall of 2017. The program itself is a ranking information retrieval system for searching small collections of full-text documents. More specifically, the system allows the storing of books from the website www.gutenburg.org and allows the retrieval and ranking of specific passages based on search criteria specified by the user.
