				Aspiring Software Engineer
			
				<hr />
				<p>I acquired my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from James Madison University in the Spring of 2019, along with a minor in mathematics. With experience in software engineering, parallel programming and multimedia software development, I aspire to be a software engineer. As a former student athlete and teaching assistant, I also aspire to work with others in helping them achieve their goals.
