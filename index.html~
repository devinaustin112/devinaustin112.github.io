				About Me
			</header>
			<hr />
			<p>I acquired my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from James Madison University in the Spring of 2019, along with a minor in mathematics. With experience in multimedia software development, parallel programming and software engineering, I aspire to be a software designer. As a former student athlete and teaching assistance, I also aspire to work with others in helping them achieve their goals.
